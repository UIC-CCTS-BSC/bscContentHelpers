# bscContentHelpers

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of bscContentHelpers is to provide templates and utilities for creating, editing, and storing documents for the UIC CCTS Biostatistics Core.

## Installation

You can install the development version of bscContentHelpers from [Github](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
install_github("rmlane/bscContenHelpers")
```

The repository is currently private, so you will need an authorization key. The package must be installed to access the document templates, functions, and supporting files.

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example, eval = FALSE}
library(bscContentHelpers)
## basic example code
```

## Document Templates

Each document template relies on three files: [an .Rmd template](#rmd-template), [an output format](#output-format), and [a knit function](#knit-function).

### A .Rmd Template

At its most basic, an .Rmd template is a sample file, written in R Markdown, that may include standard headers, sample code, or boilerplate text. It will also contain default and placeholder settings in a header block. 





In the context of an R package, an Rmd template also includes supporting documents and settings. This controls the structure of a document. For example, it 

Create a new blank document based on a template by calling `rmarkdown::draft()`.

For example, to create a new tipsheet, call:

```{r}
rmarkdown::draft("covid_tipsheet.Rmd", template = "tipsheet", package = "bscContentHelpers")
```

If the package is installed, templates are also available through the `File > New File > R Markdown... > From Template` dialog box in R Studio.

Existing BSC templates include:

* Tipsheet. This could also be used for a short article.

### An Output Format

This is an R function that defines the file type (e.g., docx, html) and the look and feel of the output document. It should be referenced in the YAML frontmatter of the Rmd document.

Current custom formats:

* `html_draft`. This should be used while developing content to avoid focusing too much on the final aesthetic details. 

TODO: 

* `tipsheet_pdf`


### A Knit Function {#knit-function}

This controls the behavior of the knit button; in other words, it determines how the Rmd draft gets turned into the PDF output. Some settings are customizable (for example, should the final document include a table of contents?). Others are pre-set.

In general, you should not need to make any changes to the knit function, beyond possibly changing some parameters.


## Google Drive Integration

Templates and documents are stored in a [BSC Content folder on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16XepzMyzRAK4pcuET8goearkb0J5GwLP). They can be accessed through R Studio via the [`googledrive` package](https://googledrive.tidyverse.org/). 

Reading and writing files requires allowing the R package to access your Google Drive account. To ensure you have access, run:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# if necessary, install the package
install.packages("googledrive")

# view files and folders in the BSC Content Google Drive folder
googledrive::drive_ls(as_id(gd_id), recursive = FALSE)
```

You should be sent to a login screen. Authorize Tidyverse API to access your Google account.

Files can be saved to and read from specific Google Drive locations. Every Google Drive folder has a unique id, equivalent to the id used in the URL in a web browser.

![Google Drive folder id](man/figures/gd_id.png)
To look up the id of a subfolder (nested within BSC Content), use `find_gd_id()`

```{r}
find_gd_id("Templates")
```


Any time an .Rmd template is updated in this package, generate a fresh copy and send it to the `BSC Content/Templates` folder. This will overwrite the existing copy on Google Drive.

```{r}
upload_template_to_drive("tipsheet")
```


## TODO

- [ ] decide when, where, and how files should be uploaded to Drive
- [ ] set target (dynamic) locations for outputs
- [ ] write a `knit_template` function that will regenerate Rmd templates in Drive
- [ ] workflows and functions to convert from one template to another
- [ ] connect document titles to file names (and calls to `rmarkdown::draft()`)
- [ ] where to set output doc parameters for use in knit fxn?
