# bscContentHelpers

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

`bscContentHelpers` provides templates and utilities for creating, editing, and rendering documents for the UIC CCTS Biostatistics Core.

## Quick Start

This section walks through the process of creating a draft R Markdown document from a template, customizing the document, and "knitting" it to an output format.

### Install Software and R Packages

The primary workflow described here relies on [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), so be sure to install those first. Workarounds to RStudio are possible but probably not worth the hassle. You'll also want to install the `devtools` package:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
```

You can install the development version of `bscContentHelpers` from [Github](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("UIC-CCTS-BSC/bscContentHelpers")
```

Note that this package isn't on CRAN, so updates won't be picked up by running `update.packages()`. However, once it's installed, you should be able to run `devtools::update_packages()`.

The current package relies on several underlying packages and software products (pandoc, `rmarkdown`, `bookdown`, a LaTeX engine). These should be automatically installed with RStudio and `bscContentHelpers`. If you run into trouble, you can install manually:

```{r}
# install R markdown
install.packages('rmarkdown')

# install the TinyTex LaTeX engine
install.packages('tinytex')
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

### Create a Draft

This package contains several document templates--that is, boilerplate outlines for tipsheets, generic articles, slide presentations, and more. These are in a subfolder called `templates` and can be accessed with the `rmarkdown::draft()` function. 

Currently available templates in this package:

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}

# get a list of current templates...
templates <- paste(
	"*", 
	rmarkdown::available_templates(package = "bscContentHelpers", full_path = FALSE)
	)

# and display
cat(templates, sep = "\n")

```

To use the RStudio `New File` add-in to create a document draft, navigate to `File > New File > R Markdown... > From Template`. Select one of the templates from the `bscContentHelpers` package (for example, Article or Slides). 

![Create a new doc from a template.](man/figures/new_doc_from_template.png)

You can also create a new draft by manually calling `rmarkdown::draft()` with the template and package name as arguments:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
rmarkdown::draft("my_file_name", template = "article", package = "bscContentHelpers")
```

### Edit

Do a little editing of the file you just created, making use of [markdown syntax](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html) and [R code chunks](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-3.html).

You can also edit fields in the YAML header or leave them as is.

### Knit

Convert the .Rmd draft to a formatted HTML document by clicking RStudio's `Knit` button or using the `Ctrl + Shift + K` keyboard shortcut. The document is ready for previewing or sharing. 

There are many other output file types (.docx, .pptx, .pdf) and formats possible. [See below](#under-the-hood) for details.


### For More Detail...

The internet is full of great explanations of what R Markdown is, how to use it, and how to extend it. Some references: 

* [R Markdown: The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)
* [R Markdown Cookbook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/)
* [The Epidemiologist R Handbook](https://epirhandbook.com/en/reports-with-r-markdown.html)


## Why (R) Markdown?

TODO

## Under the Hood

The document development and rendering process relies on three components: [an .Rmd template](#an-r-markdown-template), [an output format](#an-output-format), and [a knit function](#a-knit-function).

### An R Markdown Template

At its most basic level, an .Rmd template is a sample file, written in R Markdown, that may include standard headers, sample code, or boilerplate text. An R Markdown template defines the content and structure of a document. 

Templates defined in this package include:

* Article. This could be used for a tipsheet, tutorial, or other short article.
* Slides. This is set up to create a PowerPoint presentation or Beamer slideshow.

R Markdown documents start with a section called a YAML header, bordered by three tick marks (`---`). This section defines the settings of your final document, including metadata (e.g., title, author, date) and output format and behavior (e.g., Word document with a certain set of fonts, saved with a specific file name in a specific location on your computer). Each template in this package has a default YAML header. Some variables, like `title`, should be edited to match your specific document. Others, like default output settings, can likely be left alone.

The rest of the document is written in R Markdown. Study the placeholder text in each template; it will give you pointers about how to structure your own document in R Markdown.

[TODO]

* all templates: create as directory
* all templates: create `images/` subdirectory
* `webpage` template for web-only content
	* default YAML
	* default naming, organization
	* include attachment block
	* include `images/`, `files/`

### An Output Format

In the R Markdown workflow, an "output format" is an R function that defines the desired file type (e.g., pdf or pptx) and the look and feel (e.g., colors, fonts) of your final document. 

Note that the same source document can be rendered in multiple output formats. (This is one of the benefits of using R Markdown!) For example, suppose you're working on an article. During the writing and editing phase, you might periodically knit it to an HTML draft so you can preview the content. Once you're done, you can knit it to a pdf with standard headers, fonts, and colors. You might also create version as a markdown or HTML fragment for the website. Each format has default settings, some of which can be customized at the document level.

Although the output format is defined in an R function, you will rarely, if ever, execute the function directly. Instead, specify the format in your .Rmd file's YAML header. To use output format's default settings, just include the name:

```
output: word_document
```

To overwrite default settings, include your options in the header too, under the format name and indented by two spaces. For example, to generate a Word document with a table of contents, you could include the following settings in your YAML header:

```
output:
  word_document:
    toc: true
```

There are several [output formats](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/output-formats.html) native to the `rmarkdown` package. You can use any of these by including them in the YAML header. There are also a few custom output formats in this package; they incorporate components like CCTS or UIC branding (colors, fonts, logos) and standardized naming conventions. Any package-specific formats need to have the package name prepended:

```
output: 
  bscContentHelpers:word_document:
    toc: false
    theme: teal
```

Output formats and customizable options defined in this package:

* `html_draft`. This can be used while developing content to avoid focusing too much on the final aesthetic details. Customization options: 
  * `toc`. Include a table of contents at the start of the document?
  * `theme`. Name of the CSS style to use. Defaults to a plain, clean style.
* `pptx_presentation`
  * `theme`
* `word_document`
  * `theme`
  * `toc`
* `pdf_document`
	* `toc`

* html_webpage (or md_webpage) -- for static site
  - [ ] consider whether this needs a separate knit function

### A Knit Function

A knit function is an R function that controls the behavior of the knit button; in other words, it determines what steps get taken, and in what order, to turn the R Markdown draft into the final (pdf or html or docx or pptx) document. It gets executed when you knit the document by clicking the `knit` button or typing `Ctrl + Shift + k`.

Like with an output format, you don't usually execute a knit function directly. Instead, you include it in a document's YAML header:

`knit: function_name`

Currently, this package includes two custom knit functions. (If you would prefer to use [R Markdown's default knitting behavior](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/compile.html), simply delete the `knit` line from the YAML header.)

#### `bscContentHelpers::bsc_knit`

This knit function is the default in most document templates. It allows you to knit to one or more formats at once with some custom options (see below). (To knit to multiple output formats simultaneously, include all outputs under `output:` in the YAML header.) 

All arguments passed to the knit function have defaults, but some can be updated by explicitly setting parameters in the YAML header. If you're using the `bscContentHelpers::bsc_knit` function, some options include:

* `output_file: NULL`. This sets the output document name (minus the file extension). This will be the same for all output formats. If not explicitly set, it will default to the document title, minus spaces and special characters.
* `output_dir: NULL`. This sets the location where output documents are produced. Defaults to the same directory as the Rmd source. If stating explicitly, use a reference relative to the Rmd file's location.
* `dated_file: FALSE`. Append the date to the end of the file name?
* `file_date: Sys.Date()`. Date to be appended to the end of the file name, if applicable. Defaults to today's date but can be explicitly overridden. To avoid errors, pass as a date object.

#### `bscContentHelpers::knit_for_web`

This is a knit function that produces files suitable for the BSC website. By default, it creates a new folder, named after the first non-null value among the following: `output_dir`, `output_name`, `title`, input file name. Into that folder it puts an HTML version of the page, suitable for the BSC website. By default, it also creates a PDF version of the page, puts it in a `files` subfolder, and links to it from the HTML page. If you want to share additional documents via the web page (for example, another article or a CSV file), list the filepath(s) under `attachments`. To suppress PDF creation, use YAML option `include_pdf: FALSE`.

After you knit a document via the `knit_for_web` function, the entire output subfolder can be added to the website repository on Github.

## Other Helpful Tips

By default, documents refer to an external bibliography, held in `references.bib`. Add references in [BibTeX](https://www.bibtex.com/g/bibtex-format/) format. Reference them as `[@source]`.

## Enhancing This Package

The sections below explain how to structure new templates, formats, and more. The instructions don't go into detail about principles of package development or version control, but please keep these things in mind! It's a good idea to make changes on a development branch and test them before committing them to the master branch (i.e., the source of the distributed package). For more about package development, see the [R Packages book](https://r-pkgs.org/Introduction.html). For more about GitHub and version control, see the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com).

### Create a New Template in This Package

TODO: expand to a vignette

#### Step 0 [Optional but Recommended]: Sync and Switch Branches
Sync the remote repository (i.e., the current version of the files on GitHub) with your local copy. Then create and switch to a new development branch.

```
$ git fetch
$ git pull
$ git checkout -b new-working-branch
```

#### Create the Template
Generate a new Rmd template and supporting structures by calling `use_rmarkdown_template()`, part of the `usethis` package. A template should describe a type of document; for example, you might create a template for an article or for a slide presentation.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
usethis::use_rmarkdown_template("Article")
```

You'll see some messages in the console:

```
✔ Setting active project to '~/bscContentHelpers'
✔ Creating 'inst/rmarkdown/templates/article/skeleton/'
✔ Writing 'inst/rmarkdown/templates/article/template.yaml'
✔ Writing 'inst/rmarkdown/templates/article/skeleton/skeleton.Rmd'
```

#### Edit
Navigate to the newly created folder, located under `inst/rmarkdown/templates/article`. It should be structured as:


```
inst/rmarkdown/templates/article
|  template.yaml
|--skeleton/
|  |  skeleton.Rmd
```

The file `template.yaml` contains the template name and a few configurations. Edit the description, but otherwise this file can be left alone.

To edit the .Rmd template file (which will be the shell of any documents based on this template), open `skeleton/skeleton.Rmd`. This is where you should put any boilerplate text or section titles that will be available each time a new document is created based on the template. 

The header block, surrounded by three ticks (`---`), includes parameters that will be used when rendering the document to its final form. Some, like title and date, are placeholders and may be edited every time a new document is created. Others, like the output format and knit function, can be standardized in this document so they will be the same every time a document of this type is created. For more about formats and knit functions, see below. Some suggested settings:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
author: "UIC CCTS Biostatistics Core"
date: "`r format(Sys.Date(), '%B %d, %Y')`"
output: 
  bscContentHelpers::html_draft: default
  bscContentHelpers::word_document:
    toc: FALSE
    theme: "teal"
knit: bscContentHelpers::bsc_knit
```

Put supporting documents (e.g., image files or document-specific stylesheets that should be copied every time the template is used) in the `/skeleton` subfolder. Import an image:

```
![Image alt text](image-file-name.png)
```

Note that you don't need to include files that are part of the output format (like header logos or stylesheets). Those should be in `inst/rmd_files` and referred to in R scripts by `system.file("rmd_files/filename.ext", package = "bscContentHelpers")`.

#### Preview

Knit the file to see what the final version will look like. Use the `knit` button or the `Ctrl+Shift+K` shortcut.

After you preview the file, be sure to delete the output (e.g., skeleton.html).

#### Deploy

Do any package checks you want (e.g., run `devtools::check()` or `devtools::load_all()`). When you're happy, commit and push the changes. 

#### Merge [Recommended - If On a Development Branch]

On GitHub, compare the changes and initiate a pull request from the development branch to the main/master branch. Merge. Confirm. Delete the development branch.

Locally, switch to the master branch. Sync the changes. Then delete the local version of the development branch.

```
git checkout main
git fetch
git pull
git branch -d new-working-branch
```

#### Update the Installed Package

If you've made changes to the `main` branch of the package, you'll need to fetch them to update your installed version. In the console:

```
devtools::update_packages()
```

	* https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/indiedown/vignettes/walkthrough.html

### Create a New Output Format

Remember that an output format is an R function that defines the output file type and specs. Initiate the new format file by calling:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# create a new format; this is where you'll define output type and look & feel 
usethis::use_r("pptx_presentation")
```

In the format file, create a function that defines the format. In most cases, this function will base R Markdown format with some custom options.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
pptx_presentation <- function() {
 
  # call the base powerpoint_presentation format
  rmarkdown::powerpoint_presentation(
    reference_doc = "my_reference.pptx"
  )
   
}
```

Supporting files to be called by the format function should be put in `inst/rmd_files/`. This way, they'll be installed with the `bscContentHelpers` package and will be accessible to any users of your format function. See examples in `R/` (e.g., `html_draft()`) or, again, the [R Markdown documentation](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/new-formats.html) for more examples. 

### Create a New Reference Doc

You might want to do this to set up a new set of styles but leave an output format otherwise the same. The reference doc might be a reference.docx, a reference.ppt, or a reference.css.

#### Docx

It's best to start from a fresh pandoc template. In the terminal (not the R console):

```
$ pandoc -o custom-reference.docx --print-default-data-file reference.docx
```

Open the new file (`custom-reference.docx`). Built-in styles are listed in the ribbon. To edit a style, right-click its name and select `Modify...`. Change font or paragraph options or add header images. Later documents based on this reference document will have the updated styles applied.

![.docx styles](man/figures/docx_styles.png)

![.docx styles](man/figures/modify_docx_styles.png)

Save the reference document in this package's `inst/rmd_files/` directory with a descriptive name. Check and reinstall the package. The name will become a theme name that can be referenced in the yaml header (e.g., reference `teal.docx` with the yaml option `theme: "teal"`).

Note that just changing the formatting of the text in the document, without editing the underlying style, **will not** extend to documents based on this template.
