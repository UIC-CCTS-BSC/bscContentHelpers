# bscContentHelpers

`bscContentHelpers` provides templates and utilities for creating, editing, and rendering documents for the UIC CCTS Biostatistics Core.

## Quick Start

This section walks through the process of creating a draft R Markdown document from a template, customizing the document, and "knitting" it to an output format.

### Install Software and R Packages

The primary workflow described here relies on [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), so be sure to install those first. Workarounds to RStudio are possible but probably not worth the hassle. You'll also want to install the `devtools` package:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
```

You can install the development version of `bscContentHelpers` from [Github](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("UIC-CCTS-BSC/bscContentHelpers")
```

Note that this package isn't on CRAN, so updates won't be picked up by running `update.packages()`. However, once it's installed, you should be able to run `devtools::update_packages()`.

The current package relies on several underlying packages and software products (pandoc, `rmarkdown`, `bookdown`, a LaTeX engine). These should be automatically installed with RStudio and `bscContentHelpers`. If you run into trouble, you can install manually:

```{r}
# install R markdown
install.packages('rmarkdown')

# install the TinyTex LaTeX engine
install.packages('tinytex')
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

### Create a Draft

This package contains several document templates--that is, boilerplate outlines for tipsheets, generic articles, slide presentations, and more. These are in a subfolder called `templates` and can be accessed with the `rmarkdown::draft()` function. 

Currently available templates in this package:

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}

# get a list of current templates...
templates <- paste(
	"*", 
	rmarkdown::available_templates(package = "bscContentHelpers", full_path = FALSE)
	)

# and display
cat(templates, sep = "\n")

```

To create a document draft using the RStudio `New File` add-in, navigate to `File > New File > R Markdown... > From Template`. Select one of the templates from the `bscContentHelpers` package (for example, Article or Slides).

You can also create a new draft by manually calling `rmarkdown::draft()` with the template and package name as arguments:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
rmarkdown::draft("my_file_name", template = "article", package = "bscContentHelpers")
```

### Edit

Study the top section of the document, called the YAML header. Feel free to edit these options or leave them as is. [See below](#under-the-hood) for more information.

Below the YAML header (after the closing `---` marks) is the document body. Do a little editing of the content, making use of [markdown syntax](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html) and [R code chunks](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-3.html). The template contains tips for content formatting.

### Knit

Each template has a default output format, usually explicitly named in the YAML header block. For example, the `article` template defaults to `bscContentHelpers::html_draft`. Convert the .Rmd draft to this output format by clicking RStudio's `Knit` button or using the `Ctrl + Shift + K` keyboard shortcut. An HTML document will be generated and should open automatically. 


HTML drafts are good for previewing content as you develop it, but there are many other output file types (.docx, .pptx, .pdf) and formats possible. Try changing the YAML `output` option to `bscContentHelpers::pdf_document` and knit the document again. To knit to multiple formats simultaneously, list them all in the header.
