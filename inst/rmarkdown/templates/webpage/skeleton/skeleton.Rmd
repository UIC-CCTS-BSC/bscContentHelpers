## Note About Headers

When this file is rendered as a webpage, the title will be assigned an `<H1>` html tag. It's a good idea to make the header hierarchy for page content start with level 2 (i.e., start the line with `##`) so section headers don't compete with the page title for importance.

## Overview

Update this template with your custom content. Then create a formatted output document by pressing the `Knit` button in or using the `Shift + Ctrl + K` shortcut in R Studio. 

A new output directory will be created, containing a copy of this .Rmd file (renamed `index.Rmd`) and subfolders for supporting documents. 

## YAML Header Options

### Web-specific options

TODO: expand

slug, weight, type, tags

### Knit Function

The default knit function for this document is `bscContentHelpers::knit_for_web`. When you knit the document, a few things will happen:

* A "page bundle" (an output folder with supporting files) will be created, with a name corresponding to this document's title. All files in the current folder will be included in the page bundle.
	* In the page bundle, this .Rmd source file will be renamed `index.Rmd`.
	* Unless you set `include_pdf` to `FALSE` in the YAML header, a PDF version of this document will be generated and put in the page bundle's `files/` subdirectory.
	* Any additional attachments named in the YAML header will also be copied to `files/`.
	* A code chunk will be added to the end of the document to insert links to all attachments in `files/`.

The page bundle will be suitable for inclusion in the BSC site. (Note that you'll still need to preview and build the page locally before it can go live on the site. See the site repo and README for more.)

### Other Output Formats

If you'd rather just output a static document (like a PDF), you're better off using the `Article` template. 

### Other Document Options

You can set some additional properties in the header, such as output file name and location. If you don't customize these, defaults will be used. See the README for more.


## Shortcodes

Some code should just be rendered if the output is HTML (e.g., a web page). Conditionally execute code chunks by setting `eval=knitr::is_html_output()`.

Shortcodes are special types of code chunks specifically for webpages built with Hugo.

* [More from blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/content.html#shortcode)
* [More from geekdocs](https://geekdocs.de/)

Some useful shortcodes:

```{r,  eval=knitr::is_html_output(), echo = FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode_open("hint", "warning")
```

Only evaluate shortcodes if output is html. Suppress for pdf.


```{r,  eval=knitr::is_html_output(), echo = FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode_close("hint")
```




## Markdown

This document is written in [R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/).

Some common markdown syntax is demonstrated below. More information is available from [RStudio](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html), among many other places.

### Text Formatting
Text can easily be made *italic* or **bold** or ~~strikethrough~~ or ~subscript~ or ^superscript^.

### Lists
You can make unordered lists:

* An item
* Another item

You can also make ordered lists:

1. Something
2. A second thing
2. Note that the numbers don't need to be correct. R Markdown will take care of numbering the list during rendering.

### Code Chunks

Embed R code and results via code chunks. You can decide whether to print the code, the results, and any messages or warnings.

```{r mean-speed, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
mean_speed <- mean(cars$speed)
mean_speed
```

Objects in the current environment are accessible via inline code. For example, the mean speed of the `cars` dataset is `r mean_speed`.

If you want to print the code verbatim without running it, you can do that by adjusting the chunk options:

```{r min-speed-noeval, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
min_speed <- min(cars$speed)
min_speed
```

And if you want to run code without printing it, you can do that too.

```{r max-speed-noecho, eval = TRUE, include = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
max_speed <- max(cars$speed)
max_speed
```

The maximum speed is `r max_speed`.

### Images

Save image files in the `images/` subdirectory. Insert them into the document like this:

```{r, fig.cap="This is the image caption", eval = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("path/to/image.png")
```

### Equations

Equations can be easily inserted with standard LaTeX syntax. Inline: $y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_i + \varepsilon_i$

Standalone:

$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_i + \varepsilon_i$$


### Figures and Tables

Print a formatted table with `knitr::kable()` and refer to it as Table \@ref(tab:cars-table):

```{r cars-table}
knitr::kable(
  head(cars),
  caption = "A table with some car data." #,longtable = TRUE
  )
```

Tip: to allow tables to break across PDF pages, pass `kable(..., longtable = TRUE)`.

Generate a plot and refer to it as Figure \@ref(fig:cars-figure):

```{r cars-figure, fig.cap = "A plot of some car data."}
plot(cars)
```



### Citations

Citations are stored as [BibTeX](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html) entries in [references.bib](references.bib). They can be referenced inline by BibTeX id [@rmarkdown].

### Footnotes

Insert a footnote anywhere.[^my-note]

[^my-note]: Citations and footnotes will be formatted automatically when you render the document.

<!-- ## References -->
<!-- If you include a bibliography file in the YAML frontmatter, a references section will be automatically added to the end of your document. -->
