## Overview

Update this template with your custom content. 

While drafting this document, you may want to preview a formatted version. The easiest way to do that is to open this file in RStudio and click the `Knit` button in the top toolbar. 

## R Markdown

This document is written in [R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/).

Some common markdown syntax is demonstrated below. More information is available from [RStudio](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html), among many other places.

### Text Formatting
Text can easily be made *italic* or **bold** or ~~strikethrough~~ or ~subscript~ or ^superscript^.

### Lists
You can make unordered lists:

* An item
* Another item

You can also make ordered lists:

1. Something
2. A second thing
2. Note that the numbers don't need to be correct. R Markdown will take care of numbering the list during rendering.

### Images

Save image files in a subfolder called `images/` in the same location as this file. Insert them into the document like this:

```
![This is an image caption.](images/filename.jpg)
```

### Equations

Equations can be easily inserted with standard LaTeX syntax. Inline: $y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_i + \varepsilon_i$

Standalone:

$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_i + \varepsilon_i$$



### Footnotes

Insert a footnote anywhere.[^my-note]

[^my-note]: Citations and footnotes will be formatted automatically when you render the document.



### Citations

To add citations at the end of this article, you need to do three things:

1. Create a new file called `references.bib` and populate it with your list of sources.
2. Insert reference IDs into this file where you want citations to appear.
3. Uncomment the `# bibliography: "references.bib"` line in the header of this file. (In other words, delete the `#` at the beginning of the file.) 

#### Step 1: references.bib

Create a new file called "references.bib" in the same folder as this article. Add your references to that that file in [BibTeX](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html) format. 

Here's an example of BibTeX format:
```
@article{Cohen1992,
  doi       = {10.1037/0033-2909.112.1.155},
  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.112.1.155},
  year      = {1992},
  publisher = {American Psychological Association ({APA})},
  volume    = {112},
  number    = {1},
  pages     = {155--159},
  author    = {Jacob Cohen},
  title     = {A power primer.},
  journal   = {Psychological Bulletin}
}
```

Many reference managers will allow you to copy or export BibTeX versions of saved references. For example:

* [EndNote](https://libguides.utsa.edu/c.php?g=522165&p=7949194)
* [Mendeley](https://blog.mendeley.com/2011/10/25/howto-use-mendeley-to-create-citations-using-latex-and-bibtex/)

[www.doi2bib](https://www.doi2bib.org/) is a useful website that will generate a formatted BibTeX entry from a DOI.

#### Step 2. In-Line Citations

Every BibTeX entry in references.bib should start with a unique ID (e.g., `Cohen1992`). To reference a book or article in this article, insert its unique ID with an `@` symbol in front. For example, I could add a reference to the Cohen article by inserting `[@Cohen1992]` into this paragraph. 

#### Step 3. YAML

You need to include the line `bibliography: "references.bib"` in the YAML header of this file so the knit function can find the file. Delete the `#` sign to change the line from a comment into an active argument.



### Code Chunks

Embed R code and results via code chunks. You can decide whether to print the code, the results, and any messages or warnings.

```{r mean-speed, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
mean_speed <- mean(cars$speed)
mean_speed
```

Objects in the current environment are accessible via inline code. For example, the mean speed of the `cars` dataset is `r mean_speed`.

If you want to print the code verbatim without running it, you can do that by adjusting the chunk options:

```{r min-speed-noeval, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
min_speed <- min(cars$speed)
min_speed
```

And if you want to run code without printing it, you can do that too.

```{r max-speed-noecho, eval = TRUE, include = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
max_speed <- max(cars$speed)
max_speed
```

The maximum speed is `r max_speed`.

### Figures and Tables

Print a formatted table with `knitr::kable()` and refer to it as Table \@ref(tab:cars-table):

```{r cars-table}
knitr::kable(
  head(cars),
  caption = "A table with some car data." #,longtable = TRUE
  )
```

Tip: to allow tables to break across PDF pages, pass `kable(..., longtable = TRUE)`.

Generate a plot and refer to it as Figure \@ref(fig:cars-figure):

```{r cars-figure, fig.cap = "A plot of some car data."}
plot(cars)
```
