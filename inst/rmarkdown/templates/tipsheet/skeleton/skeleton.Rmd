# Overview

This is a template. Update it with your custom content. Change output settings in the YAML header at the top of this file (between the two sets of `---` marks). Then render it to a formatted document by doing one of the following: 

* In R Studio, press the `Knit` button or use the `Shift + Ctrl + K` shortcut.
* In the R console, run `rmarkdown::render('input.Rmd')` with any rendering options. Note that this method won't pick up some of the configuration options defined in this format, so you'll need to declare them on explicitly. Read more about `rmarkdown::render()` [here](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/docs/reference/render.html).

# Markdown Options

This document is written in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), with some extra functionality through the [rmarkdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) [@rmarkdown] and [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) [@bookdown] packages.

Some common markdown syntax is demonstrated below. More information is available from [RStudio](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html), among many other places.

## Text Formatting
Text can easily be made *italic* or **bold** or ~~strikethrough~~ or ~subscript~ or ^superscript^.

## Lists
You can make unordered lists:

* First item
* Second item

You can also make ordered lists:

1. Something
2. Another thing
2. Note that the numbers don't need to be correct. R Markdown will take care of numbering the list during rendering.

## Equations

Equations can be easily inserted with standard LaTeX syntax. Inline: $y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_i + \varepsilon_i$

Standalone:

$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_i + \varepsilon_i$$

## Code Chunks

Embed R code and results via code chunks. You can decide whether to print the code, the results, and any messages or warnings.

```{r mean-speed, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
mean_speed <- mean(cars$speed)
mean_speed
```

Objects in the current environment are accessible via inline code. For example, the mean speed of the `cars` dataset is `r mean_speed`.

If you want to print the code verbatim without running it, you can do that by adjusting the chunk options:

```{r mean-speed-noeval, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
mean_speed <- mean(cars$speed)
mean_speed
```

## Figures and Tables

Print a formatted table with `knitr::kable()` and refer to it as Table \@ref(tab:cars-table):

```{r cars-table}
knitr::kable(
  head(cars),
  caption = "A table with some car data." #,longtable = TRUE
  )
```

Tip: to allow tables to break across PDF pages, pass `kable(..., longtable = TRUE)`.

Generate a plot and refer to it as Figure \@ref(fig:cars-figure):

```{r cars-figure, fig.cap = "A plot of some car data."}
plot(cars)
```

You can also include an image from an external file, as with Figure \@ref(fig:cat-figure):

```{r cat-figure, fig.cap = "An image of a cat."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/cat.jpg")
```

## Definitions

Definition 1
: "Definitions" are specially formatted key-value pairings. 

Definition 2
: These are good for consistently formatting glossaries. 

## Links, Citations, and Footnotes

Citations are stored as [BibTeX](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html) entries in [references.bib](references.bib). They can be referenced inline by BibTeX id [@rmarkdown].

Insert a footnote anywhere.[^my-note]

[^my-note]: Citations and footnotes will be formatted automatically when you render the document.
