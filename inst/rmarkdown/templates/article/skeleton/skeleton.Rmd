# Overview

Update this template with your custom content. Then create  formatted output document by pressing the `Knit` button in or using the `Shift + Ctrl + K` shortcut in R Studio.

# YAML Header Options

## Output Formats

Review the package documentation for more about configuring the output. In brief, you should choose one or more output format: 

* `bscContentHelpers::html_draft`
* `bscContentHelpers::word_document`
* `bscContentHelpers::pptx_document`

This template is oriented toward html, Word, or PDF output, but you can choose anything you want. Include multiple formats to knit them all at once. Delete or comment out the ones you don't need.

Some output formats allow additional configurations (table of contents, color scheme or logo, etc). See the README for more.

## Other Document Options

You can set some additional properties in the header, such as output file name and location. If you don't customize these, defaults will be used. See the README for more.

# Markdown

This document is written in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), with some extra functionality through the [rmarkdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) [@rmarkdown] and [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) [@bookdown] packages.

Some common markdown syntax is demonstrated below. More information is available from [RStudio](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html), among many other places.

## Text Formatting
Text can easily be made *italic* or **bold** or ~~strikethrough~~ or ~subscript~ or ^superscript^.

## Lists
You can make unordered lists:

* First item
* Second item

You can also make ordered lists:

1. Something
2. Another thing
2. Note that the numbers don't need to be correct. R Markdown will take care of numbering the list during rendering.

## Equations

Equations can be easily inserted with standard LaTeX syntax. Inline: $y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_i + \varepsilon_i$

Standalone:

$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_i + \varepsilon_i$$

## Code Chunks

Embed R code and results via code chunks. You can decide whether to print the code, the results, and any messages or warnings.

```{r mean-speed, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
mean_speed <- mean(cars$speed)
mean_speed
```

Objects in the current environment are accessible via inline code. For example, the mean speed of the `cars` dataset is `r mean_speed`.

If you want to print the code verbatim without running it, you can do that by adjusting the chunk options:

```{r mean-speed-noeval, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
mean_speed <- mean(cars$speed)
mean_speed
```

## Figures and Tables

Print a formatted table with `knitr::kable()` and refer to it as Table \@ref(tab:cars-table):

```{r cars-table}
knitr::kable(
  head(cars),
  caption = "A table with some car data." #,longtable = TRUE
  )
```

Tip: to allow tables to break across PDF pages, pass `kable(..., longtable = TRUE)`.

Generate a plot and refer to it as Figure \@ref(fig:cars-figure):

```{r cars-figure, fig.cap = "A plot of some car data."}
plot(cars)
```

You can also include an image from an external file or online location, as in Figure \@ref(fig:external-figure):

```{r external-figure, fig.cap = "An external image.", out.width="25%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://ipce.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/41/2018/10/CAMP.CIRC_.LG_.BLK_.png")
```

## Citations

Citations are stored as [BibTeX](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html) entries in [references.bib](references.bib). They can be referenced inline by BibTeX id [@rmarkdown].

## Footnotes

Insert a footnote anywhere.[^my-note]

[^my-note]: Citations and footnotes will be formatted automatically when you render the document.
